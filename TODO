Notes about the test modules
----------------------------

legend_of_faerghail - this is the only SoundTracker module (15 samples), also
turns on the filter for the whole duration of the song

killing road - play pattern backwards trick (pattern break & position jump
commands on the same row)

condom corruption - correct handling of pattern break and pattern delay
in the same row (middle breakdown)

canalgreen - correct handling of pattern delay & pattern loop commands in the
intro (for pattern delays, 'first tick' should mean the real first tick AND
every Nth tick where N is all integer multiples of the ticksPerRow (speed);
effects that do not process on the 'first tick' need to take this into
consideration)

living insanity - lots of delay note and retrigger note commands

kaviar - the intro turns the filter on
