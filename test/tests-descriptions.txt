TEST DESCRIPTIONS
*****************

It is indicated next to each test case whether the current behaviour of the
renderer is accurate compared to the ProTracker v2.3D playroutine or not.

  [OK]   - behaviour is the same as in ProTracker v2.3D
  [FAIL] - behaviour is NOT the same as in ProTracker (see further
           comments)

ProTracker v2.3D was run not on a real Amiga, but in WinUAE (emulated A1200),
to carry out the tests. In theory, that shouldn't make much of a difference.


EFFECTS
=======

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Arpeggio (0xy)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The arpeggio command should be performed on every tick:

  tick MOD 3 = 0  -> original note (only retrigger on the first tick)
  tick MOD 3 = 1  -> x semitone up (without retriggering)
  tick MOD 3 = 2  -> y semitone up (without retriggering)
  ...


## Test 1:   arpeggio.mod

rows 0      [OK]
Do nothing if note and samplenum are empty, and no note was previously played
on the channel.

row 1       [OK]
Do nothing if note is empty, the samplenum of a non-empty sample is provided,
and no note was previously played on the channel.

row 2       [OK]
Do nothing if note is empty, the samplenum of an empty sample is provided,
and no note was previously played on the channel.

rows 3-4    [OK]
Do nothing if note is provided, samplenum is empty, and no note was
previously played on the channel.

rows 5-18   [FAIL]
Do sample swap, start playing the arpeggio from the loop start position,
ignoring the finetune setting. Keep playing the non-finetuned note from row
8 after the arpeggio ended. The fine tuned note can be heard on row 12 for
pitch reference.
*NOTE* This is probably due to a sample swapping bug.

row 19-21   [OK]
Play an arpeggio really slowly.

row 22-26   [OK]
Increase pich then continue playing the arpeggio.

row 27-31   [OK]
Both arpeggio notes are the same.

row 32-36   [OK]
Only the first arpeggio note is used, the second one is zero.

row 37-56   [OK]
Test different speed (ticks per row) settings.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Slide up (1xy)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The slide up command should be performed on every tick but the very first.


## Test 1:         slide-up.mod

row 0       [OK]
Do nothing if note and samplenum are empty, speed is empty, and no note was
previously played on the channel.

row 1       [OK]
Do nothing if note and samplenum are empty, speed is provided, and no note
was previously played on the channel.

row 2       [OK]
Do nothing if note is empty, the samplenum of a non-empty sample is provided,
and no note was previously played on the channel.

row 3       [OK]
Do nothing if note is empty, the samplenum of an empty sample is provided,
and no note was previously played on the channel.

rows 4-5    [OK]
Do nothing if note is provided, samplenum is empty, and no note was
previously played on the channel.

rows 6-13   [FAIL]
Do sample swap, start playing from the loop start position and do the slide.
*NOTE* This is probably due to a sample swapping bug.

rows 14-21  [OK*]
Do the slide up and clamp period to Amiga limits.

* When playing a sample at B-3 with finetune 0, a strange distortion starts to
  appear on a real Amiga because the DMA cannot fetch the samples quickly
  enough so it starts skipping a few (this is emulated well in WinUAE).  Using
  higher finetune values makes the sound progressively more distorted. This is
  not emulated in the player, but I don't think it's too important (or even
  desirable).

rows 22-27  [OK]
Slide up should have NO effect memory.

rows 28-32  [OK]
Slide up should be performed on every tick but the very first when there's
a pattern delay (EEx) command on the same row.

rows 33-37  [OK]
Do nothing if no slide speed is provided.

rows 38-50  [FAIL]
First a B-3 note with finetune +7 is played, then two slide up that should be
clamped to the same period as the first note.
*NOTE* The slides are clamped fine, but the first note is not clamped
correctly.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Slide down (2xy)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The slide up command should be performed on every tick but the very first.


## Test 1:         slide-down.mod

row 0       [OK]
Do nothing if note and samplenum are empty, speed is empty, and no note was
previously played on the channel.

row 1       [OK]
Do nothing if note and samplenum are empty, speed is provided, and no note
was previously played on the channel.

row 2       [OK]
Do nothing if note is empty, the samplenum of a non-empty sample is provided,
and no note was previously played on the channel.

row 3       [OK]
Do nothing if note is empty, the samplenum of an empty sample is provided,
and no note was previously played on the channel.

rows 4-5    [OK]
Do nothing if note is provided, samplenum is empty, and no note was
previously played on the channel.

rows 6-13   [FAIL]
Do sample swap, start playing from the loop start position and do the slide.
*NOTE* This is probably due to a sample swapping bug.

rows 14-27  [OK]
Do the slide down and clamp period to Amiga limits. Note that the lower limit
is C-1 with finetune 0. A C-1 note with finetune -7 is played next for
reference.

rows 28-34  [OK]
Due to the clamp period limits, sliding down from a C-1 note with a negative
finetune value (-7 in this case) will set the period to C-1 with finetune
0 immediately, regardless of the slide down speed setting.

rows 35-40  [OK]
Slide down should have NO effect memory.

rows 41-45  [OK]
Slide up should be performed on every tick but the very first when there's
a pattern delay (EEx) command on the same row.

rows 46-50  [OK]
Do nothing if no slide speed is provided.

TODO


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vibrato (4xy)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vibrato should be only performed on non-first ticks. This results in a pretty
funky vibrato on lower vibrato speeds.


## Test 1:         vibrato-general.mod

previously played on the channel.

Each channel should have its own vibrato effect memory.

rows 18-33  [OK]
Vibrato should not be performed only on non-first ticks.

rows 34-48  [OK]
It should be possible to set only vibrato speed or depth; the other parameter
value should be remembered.

rows 51-63  [OK]
Vibrato should be performed on every tick but the very first when there's
a pattern delay (EEx) command on the same row.


## Test 2:         vibrato-retrigger.mod

row 0-8     [OK]
Just the samplenum without a note should not retrigger the vibrato
position

row 0-23    [OK]
A new note should retrigger the vibrato position.

rows 10-23  [OK]
Changing the vibrato parameters should not change the vibrato position.

rows 25-35  [OK]
Other effects should not affect the vibrato position.
