TEST DESCRIPTIONS
*****************

It is indicated next to each test case whether the current behaviour of the
renderer is accurate compared to the ProTracker v2.3D playroutine or not.

  [OK]   - behaviour is the same as in ProTracker v2.3D
  [FAIL] - behaviour is NOT the same as in ProTracker (see further
           comments)

ProTracker v2.3D was run not on a real Amiga, but in WinUAE (emulated A1200),
to carry out the tests. In theory, that shouldn't make much of a difference.


EFFECTS
=======

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Arpeggio (0xy)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The arpeggio effect should be performed on every tick:

  tick MOD 3 = 0  -> original note (only retrigger on the first tick)
  tick MOD 3 = 1  -> x semitone up (without retriggering)
  tick MOD 3 = 2  -> y semitone up (without retriggering)
  ...


## Test 1:         arpeggio.mod

#01: rows 0      [OK]
Do nothing if note and samplenum are empty, and no note was previously played
on the channel.

#02: row 1       [OK]
Do nothing if note is empty, the samplenum of a non-empty sample is provided,
and no note was previously played on the channel.

#03: row 2       [OK]
Do nothing if note is empty, the samplenum of an empty sample is provided,
and no note was previously played on the channel.

#04: rows 3-4    [OK]
Do nothing if note is provided, samplenum is empty, and no note was
previously played on the channel.

#05: rows 5-18   [FAIL]
Do sample swap, start playing the arpeggio from the loop start position,
ignoring the finetune setting. Keep playing the non-finetuned note from row
8 after the arpeggio ended. The fine tuned note can be heard on row 12 for
pitch reference.
*NOTE* This is probably due to a sample swapping bug.

#06: row 19-21   [OK]
Play an arpeggio really slowly.

#07: row 22-26   [OK]
Increase pich then continue playing the arpeggio.

#08: row 27-31   [OK]
Both arpeggio notes are the same.

#09: row 32-36   [OK]
Only the first arpeggio note is used, the second one is zero.

#10: row 37-56   [OK]
Test different speed (ticks per row) settings.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Slide up (1xy)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The slide up effect should be performed on every tick but the very first.
It should not have effect memory.


## Test 1:         slide-up.mod

#01: row 0       [OK]
Do nothing if note and samplenum are empty, speed is empty, and no note was
previously played on the channel.

#02: row 1       [OK]
Do nothing if note and samplenum are empty, speed is provided, and no note
was previously played on the channel.

#03: row 2       [OK]
Do nothing if note is empty, the samplenum of a non-empty sample is provided,
and no note was previously played on the channel.

#04: row 3       [OK]
Do nothing if note is empty, the samplenum of an empty sample is provided,
and no note was previously played on the channel.

#05: rows 4-5    [OK]
Do nothing if note is provided, samplenum is empty, and no note was
previously played on the channel.

#06: rows 6-13   [OK]
Do sample swap, start playing from the loop start position and do the slide.

#07: rows 14-21  [OK*]
Do the slide up and clamp period to Amiga limits.

* When playing a sample at B-3 with finetune 0, a strange distortion starts to
  appear on a real Amiga because the DMA cannot fetch the samples quickly
  enough so it starts skipping a few (this is emulated well in WinUAE).  Using
  higher finetune values makes the sound progressively more distorted. This is
  not emulated in the player, but I don't think it's too important (or even
  desirable).

#08: rows 22-27  [OK]
Slide up should have NO effect memory.

#09: rows 28-32  [OK]
Slide up should be performed on every tick but the very first when there's
a pattern delay (EEx) command on the same row.

#10: rows 33-37  [OK]
Do nothing if no slide speed is provided.

#11: rows 38-50  [OK*]
First a B-3 note with finetune +7 is played, then two slide up that should be
clamped to the same period as the first note.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Slide down (2xy)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The slide up effect should be performed on every tick but the very first.
It should not have effect memory.


## Test 1:         slide-down.mod

row 0       [OK]
Do nothing if note and samplenum are empty, speed is empty, and no note was
previously played on the channel.

row 1       [OK]
Do nothing if note and samplenum are empty, speed is provided, and no note
was previously played on the channel.

row 2       [OK]
Do nothing if note is empty, the samplenum of a non-empty sample is provided,
and no note was previously played on the channel.

row 3       [OK]
Do nothing if note is empty, the samplenum of an empty sample is provided,
and no note was previously played on the channel.

rows 4-5    [OK]
Do nothing if note is provided, samplenum is empty, and no note was
previously played on the channel.

rows 6-13   [FAIL]
Do sample swap, start playing from the loop start position and do the slide.
*NOTE* This is probably due to a sample swapping bug.

rows 14-27  [OK]
Do the slide down and clamp period to Amiga limits. Note that the lower limit
is C-1 with finetune 0. A C-1 note with finetune -7 is played next for
reference.

rows 28-34  [OK]
Due to the clamp period limits, sliding down from a C-1 note with a negative
finetune value (-7 in this case) will set the period to C-1 with finetune
0 immediately, regardless of the slide down speed setting.

rows 35-40  [OK]
Slide down should have NO effect memory.

rows 41-45  [OK]
Slide up should be performed on every tick but the very first when there's
a pattern delay (EEx) command on the same row.

rows 46-50  [OK]
Do nothing if no slide speed is provided.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tone portamento (3xy)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The tone portamento effect should be performed on every tick but the very
first. It should have per-channel effect memory.


## Test 1:         tone-portamento.mod

Do nothing if note and samplenum are empty, speed and depth are empty, and no
note was previously played on the channel.

a pattern delay (EEx) command on the same row.

rows 16-18  [OK]
Portamento should have per-channel effect memory.

rows 19-21  [OK]
Portamento should work when the samplenum of the destination note is empty.

rows 19-24  [OK]
If the destination note is not specified, and the preceeding portamento
command has reached the desination note on the channel (rows 19-21), no
portamento should be performed.

rows 25-31  [OK]
If the destination note is not specified, and the preceeding portamento
command has NOT reached the desination note on the channel (rows 25-28),
portamento should be performed to the preceeding destination note from the
current note (so the portamento "restarts").

rows 32-34  [OK]
Sample-swapping should work with portamento.

rows 35-37  [OK]
Portamento up should respect Amiga limits.

rows 38-40  [OK]
Portamento down should respect Amiga limits.

rows 41-43  [OK]
Portamento to the same not should have no effect.

rows 44-46  [OK]
Portamento should work correctly if the pitch was changed by some other effect
(e.g. slide up).

rows 47-63  [OK]
Each channel should have its own portamento effect memory.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vibrato (4xy)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vibrato should be only performed on non-first ticks. This results in a pretty
funky vibrato on lower vibrato speeds. It should have per-channel effect
memory.

value should be remembered.

rows 51-63  [OK]
Vibrato should be performed on every tick but the very first when there's
a pattern delay (EEx) command on the same row.


## Test 2:         vibrato-retrigger.mod

row 0-8     [OK]
Just the samplenum without a note should not retrigger the vibrato
position

row 0-23    [OK]

EXTENDED EFFECTS

Glissando control (E3x)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO per channel tests

## Test 1:         glissando.mod

rows 0-2    [OK]
Glissando control should be off by default.

rows 3-5    [OK]
E31 should turn glissando control on.

rows 6-8    [OK]
E30 should turn glissando control off.

rows 9-16   [OK]
When glissando control is on, the "rounding down" to the closest semitone
below the actual pitch should only happen during the tone portamento effect
(so the tone portamento effect always calculates the "unrounded" pitch first,
stores that as the current channel pitch so subsequent pitch manipulation
effects will use that, but the "rounded" pitch is sent to the output). If no
tone portamento is being processed, the pitch should return to the original
"unrounded" pitch (the current channel pitch).

rows 17-26  [OK]
A more complicated case of the previous example: a long pitch slide starts
with a smooth portamento, then a slight slide down, then another portamento
with glissando control on.

rows 27-33  [OK]
Downwards tone portamento with glissando control on.

rows 34-62  [OK]
E30 should turn glissando control off, any other value should turn it on.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Set vibrato waveform (E4x)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Set the vibrato waveform to one of these three waveforms for the channel:

  x MOD 3 = 0  - sine
  x MOD 3 = 1  - ramp down
  x MOD 3 = 2  - square

The waveform should be set per-channel.


## Test 1:         set-vibrato-waveform.mod

Retrig note (E9x)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The sample should be retriggered at every xth tick in the simple case, but
there are lots of weird quirks in more complicated cases (e.g. samplenum or
note is missing, when used in conjunction with the pattern delay (EEx)
command, etc.)


## Test 1:         retrig-note.mod

#01: row 0       [OK]
Do nothing if note and samplenum are empty, retrig speed is empty, and no
note was previously played on the channel.

#04: row 3       [OK]
Do nothing if note is empty, the samplenum of an empty sample is provided,
and no note was previously played on the channel.

#05: rows 5-6    [OK]
E90 should play the sample normally without retriggering.

#06: rows 7-15   [OK]
E9x should retrigger the sample at every x ticks.

#07: rows 16-18  [OK]
If the retrig speed is equal to the song speed (ticks per row), the sample
should be played normally without retriggering.

#08: rows 19-21  [OK]
If the retrig speed is greater than the song speed (ticks per row), the sample
should be played normally without retriggering.

#09: rows 22-24  [OK]
E91 should retrigger the sample at every tick.

#10: rows 25-26  [OK]
The sample should NOT be retriggered on (ellapsedTick MOD retrigSpeed == 0)
ticks when there's a pattern delay (EEx) command on the same row (but the
sample should be played on the very first tick, of course, which is the normal
sample playback).

#11: rows 25-29  [OK]
If the note and samplenum are empty, a retrig effect is present in the row,
and a sample has previously been played on the channel, the previously played
sample should be played normally first using the current chnnel pitch and
volume (note the C40 command on row 26 and the 108 command on row 27) and then
perform the retrigger.

#12: rows 30-31  [OK]
E90 should do nothing if no note and samplenum are present.

#13: rows 32-33  [OK]
If the note is not present but the samplenum is, restore the channel volume to
the default sample volume, play the note normally using the current channel
pitch and then perform the retrigger.
